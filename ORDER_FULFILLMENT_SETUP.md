# Order Fulfillment System Implementation

This document outlines the complete order fulfillment system that has been implemented for the KSO website.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Customer Purchase → Stripe Checkout → Webhook → Printful → Order Fulfillment
```

### Components:
1. **Stripe Checkout** - Payment processing
2. **Webhook Handler** - Processes successful payments
3. **Printful Integration** - Order fulfillment
4. **Database Tracking** - Order management
5. **Admin Panel** - Order monitoring

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Webhook handler
- `orders-schema.sql` - Database schema for orders
- `ORDER_FULFILLMENT_SETUP.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `src/lib/printful.ts` - Added `createPrintfulOrder` function
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added Order interface and database functions
- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` - Enhanced metadata storage
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added Orders tab

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the orders schema in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Copy and run the contents of orders-schema.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Stripe Webhook
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Printful API
PRINTFUL_API_KEY=your_printful_api_key_here

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### 3. Stripe Webhook Configuration

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables

### 4. Printful API Key

1. Go to Printful Dashboard → Stores → API
2. Generate a new API key
3. Add to your environment variables

## 🔄 Order Flow

### 1. Customer Purchase
- Customer adds items to cart
- Enters email address in shopping cart
- Proceeds to Stripe checkout
- Provides shipping and billing address during checkout
- Payment is processed

### 2. Webhook Processing
- Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` event
- Webhook handler receives the event
- Extracts order details and customer shipping address from session
- Maps Stripe products to Printful sync_product_ids

### 3. Printful Order Creation
- Creates order in Printful with customer details
- Includes complete shipping address and product information
- Returns Printful order ID

### 4. Database Storage
- Stores order in Supabase database
- Tracks order status and fulfillment progress
- Links Stripe session to Printful order

### 5. Admin Monitoring
- Orders appear in admin panel
- Real-time status tracking
- Order history and details

## 📊 Order Status Tracking

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Order created, payment pending |
| `paid` | Payment received, order confirmed |
| `processing` | Order sent to Printful for fulfillment |
| `fulfilled` | Order shipped/delivered |
| `cancelled` | Order cancelled |
| `failed` | Order processing failed |

## 🛠️ Admin Features

### Orders Tab
- View all customer orders
- Track order status
- Monitor fulfillment progress
- Order details and history

### Sync Products Tab
- Import products from Printful
- Sync to Stripe for checkout
- Manage product inventory

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Webhook not receiving events**
   - Check webhook endpoint URL
   - Verify webhook secret
   - Check Stripe dashboard for failed events

2. **Printful order creation fails**
   - Verify Printful API key
   - Check product sync_product_ids
   - Validate customer address format

3. **Database errors**
   - Run orders schema
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify table permissions

### Debug Information:

The system includes comprehensive logging:
- Webhook event processing
- Printful API calls
- Database operations
- Error handling

Check your server logs for detailed information.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy application
4. Configure Stripe webhook endpoint

### Environment Variables (Production):
```env
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
PRINTFUL_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com
```
